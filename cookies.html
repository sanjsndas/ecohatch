                <p>This Cookie Policy explains how EcoHatch ("we", "us", or "our") uses cookies and similar tracking technologies when you visit our website. It describes what these technologies are, why we use them, and your rights regarding their use. Cookies are small data files placed on your device that help us enhance your user experience, understand site usage, and improve our services.

                    <p>Cookies are small text files that websites store on your device when you visit them. They help websites remember information about your visit, such as your preferred language and other settings, making your next visit easier and more useful. Cookies are not programs and cannot contain viruses or malware. They serve various functions like enabling certain features, tracking site usage, and personalizing content. Without cookies, many basic website functions wouldn't work as intended.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">2. Types of Cookies We Use</h3>
                    <p>We use several types of cookies including strictly necessary (essential for site operation), performance/analytics (helping us understand visitor behavior), functionality (remembering your preferences), and marketing/targeting cookies (used for personalized advertising). Each type serves a specific purpose in enhancing your experience and our service quality. Strictly necessary cookies don't require consent, while others are only used with your permission as per GDPR and other privacy regulations.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">3. First-Party Cookies</h3>
                    <p>First-party cookies are set by our website domain and are generally used for functional purposes like maintaining your session state and remembering preferences. These cookies help our website function properly and provide services you explicitly request. They typically store non-identifiable information and are considered less intrusive than third-party cookies. We maintain strict control over these cookies and limit their scope to our site's operation and enhancement.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">4. Third-Party Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Third-party cookies are set by domains other than our website, usually by our trusted partners for services like analytics, advertising, and social media integration. These cookies may track your browsing across multiple sites to build a profile of your interests. We carefully vet third-party services and require them to comply with privacy laws. You can control these cookies through our consent management tool or your browser settings.</p>

                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">5. Session Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Session cookies are temporary and deleted when you close your browser. They're essential for site functionality during a single visit, maintaining your session state as you navigate between pages. Examples include keeping items in your shopping cart or maintaining secure login sessions. These cookies don't collect personal information from your device and are automatically deleted when the browsing session ends, providing transient convenience without long-term tracking.</p>

                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">6. Persistent Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Persistent cookies remain on your device between browsing sessions until they expire or you delete them. They remember your preferences and actions across our site, creating a more personalized experience. These cookies have varying lifespans set by us, from days to years, depending on their purpose. We carefully consider appropriate durations to balance functionality with privacy concerns. You can remove them anytime through browser settings.</p>

                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">7. Strictly Necessary Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Essential cookies enable core website functionality such as security, network management, and accessibility. We use them for features like maintaining your logged-in state, processing transactions, and redirecting you after login. These cookies don't require user consent under EU law but you can block them in browser settings, though this may severely impact site functionality. We minimize their use to only what's absolutely necessary for basic operations.</p>

                    <p>Performance cookies collect information about how visitors use our site, including which pages are visited most and potential error messages. This data is aggregated and anonymous, helping us improve site structure and content organization. Services like Google Analytics use these cookies to provide us with insights while protecting individual privacy. You can opt out of these cookies without affecting site functionality beyond our ability to improve user experience based on usage patterns.</p>

                    <p>Functionality cookies allow our website to remember your preferences and choices (like language, region, or login information) to provide enhanced, personalized features. They may also enable services you specifically request like watching embedded videos or commenting on blog posts. While not essential, they significantly enhance usability. The information collected is anonymized and doesn't track browsing activity on other sites.</p>

                    <p>These cookies track browsing habits to build a profile of your interests and show relevant ads on our and other sites. They're placed by advertising networks with our permission and link to browser identifiers rather than directly identifying individuals. We use these cookies sparingly and only with explicit user consent through our cookie banner. Even when declined, you'll still see ads—they just won't be personalized to your interests.</p>

                    <p>Social media cookies are set by social platforms when you interact with our content, like sharing articles or using Facebook comments. They track your activity across sites to build a profile of your interests for advertising purposes. We embed official social media buttons that only set cookies when clicked to minimize passive tracking. These cookies are controlled by the respective platforms per their privacy policies.</p>

                    <p>Each cookie has a specific lifespan ranging from the duration of your session to several years. We carefully assign appropriate durations based on cookie purpose—session cookies expire when you close your browser, preference cookies last longer to maintain your settings between visits, and analytics cookies typically have 1-2 year durations. No cookies store indefinitely, and we periodically review lifespan appropriateness to respect user privacy.</p>

                    <p>We implement multiple security measures for cookies including HTTPS encryption, Secure flag to prevent transmission over unencrypted connections, and HttpOnly flag to prevent JavaScript access. Sensitive cookies like authentication tokens have short lifespans and strict scope. We conduct regular security audits of our cookie practices and promptly address any vulnerabilities discovered. Cookies never store unprotected personal or financial information.</p>

                    <p>We obtain explicit user consent for non-essential cookies through a clear, prominent banner when you first visit our site. You can accept all, decline all, or customize cookie preferences anytime through our cookie settings panel. Consent choices are stored in a cookie (ironically) so we remember your preferences for subsequent visits. You can withdraw or modify consent at any time, with changes taking effect immediately.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookie-point">

                    <p>Beyond our cookie banner, most browsers allow you to manage cookie preferences through settings, typically found under "Privacy" or "Security" sections. You can delete existing cookies, block all cookies, or set preferences for specific sites. Note that blocking all cookies may break essential features. We provide granular control through our cookie preferences center where you can toggle categories on/off individually.</p>

                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">16. Impact of Disabling Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Disabling cookies may prevent certain site features from working properly. Essential functions like login may fail, preferences won't be remembered between visits, shopping carts won't retain items, and some content may not display correctly. Performance and functionality cookies can typically be disabled with minimal impact beyond loss of personalization. We strive to degrade gracefully when cookies are refused.</p>

                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">17. Analytics Cookies</h3>
                    <p>We use Google Analytics cookies (_ga, _gid) to collect anonymous data about site usage—pages visited, time spent, referral sources, etc. This helps us understand visitor needs and improve content. Analytics data is aggregated and doesn't identify individuals. IP addresses are anonymized before storage. You can opt out via our cookie settings or Google's Analytics Opt-out Browser Add-on.</p>

                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">18. Preference Cookies</h3>
                    <p>Preference cookies store user selections like language, region, layout preferences, and accessibility settings. For example, if you change font size or color scheme, a preference cookie remembers this for future visits. These cookies significantly enhance usability by preventing the need to reconfigure settings repeatedly. They contain no tracking information and only affect presentation of our site to you.</p>

                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">19. Authentication Cookies</h3>
                    <p>When you log into your account, we set secure, encrypted authentication cookies to maintain your login session. These contain random tokens rather than actual credentials and automatically expire after periods of inactivity or when you log out. Strict security measures protect these cookies including HTTPS-only transmission, SameSite attributes, and automatic invalidation if suspicious activity is detected.</p>
                </div>
                
                <div class="cookie-point">
                    <h3 class="text-xl font-semibold mb-2">20. Local Storage Alternatives </h3>
                <p>In addition to cookies, we may use local storage to store user preferences and session data. Local storage allows us to save larger amounts of data compared to cookies and does not have the same expiration limitations. However, it is not sent with every HTTP request like cookies, which can improve performance.
